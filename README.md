# GA1
GA1 is a simple solution that can turn on and off an LED on an Arduino
board (connected to GPIO pin 8) using an Ardino Ethernet Shield for IP
connectivity. The Arduino is controlled via a simple web application that
can run in a Browser.

The Arduino code is in the Arduino directory (with building instructions) and
the web application is in the Browser directory (also with building
instructions).

To build and run GA1 there are some common steps that must be taken:

* Install the latest version of the Golgi SDK somewhere (on OS X it will go under ~/Golgi-Pkg).
* In the developer portal at devs.golgi.io, create a new application, call it GA1.
